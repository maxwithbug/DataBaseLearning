DBMS


1.WHAT IS DATABASE ? EXPLAIN WITH AN EXAMPLE WHY WE NEED DATA BASE
          → DATABASE IS A PLACE WHERE WE STORE AND MANAGE DATA  .
 
	NEED OF DATA BASE : 
		1.COLLECTING THE  DATA IN  ONE PLCE 
		2. MAKING EASY TO MAINTAIN AND MANAGING
		3. ACCESSING , UPDATIG , DELETING EFFICIENTLY .


2.WRITE A SHORT NOTE ON FILE BASE STORAGE SYSTEM  . EXPLAIN MAJOR CHALLENGES OF FILE BASE STORAGE SYSTEM 
→ FILE BASE STORAGE SYSTEM IS A STORAGE SYSTEM WHERE WE STORE OUR DATA IN A FILE FORMAT  ON A DEVICE , WE USES IT DAILY IN OUR MOBILE AND OTHER DEVICES , BECAUSE THOSE DEVICES STORES DATA  AS FILE FOLDER FORMATS . IT’S VERY EASY TO OPARATE AND MANAGING .

THE CHALLENGES ARE :
	1.BIG SECURITY ISSUES LOOPHOLES 
	2.DATA REDUNDANCY 
	3. DATA INTEGRITY 
	4.SCALABILITY 


3.WHAT IS DBMS ? WHAT WAS THE NEED:?
	→THE FULL FORM OF DBMS IS (DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ) . IT’S A SYSTEM OR SOFTWARE FOR DATABASE  USED TO MANAGE , CREATE  INTERACT . IT’S WORKS AS  A MIDDLE MAN LIKE A LIBRARIAN .

THE NEED :
		TO FIX :
			1.BIG SECURITY ISSUES LOOP HOLES 
	2.DATA REDUNDANCY 
	3. DATA INTEGRITY 
	4.SCALABILITY 
	5.EFFICIENT ACCESSSING AND UPDATING OF DATA
	6. DATA INCONSISTENCY 

4.EXPLAIN 5 CHALLENGES FILE BASE STORAGE SYSTEM WHICH IS TALKED BY DBMS
	→        1.BIG SECURITY ISSUES LOOP HOLES 
	2.DATA REDUNDANCY 
	3. DATA INTEGRITY 
	4.SCALABILITY 
	5.EFFICIENT ACCESSSING AND UPDATING OF DATA
	6. DATA INCONSISTENCY 


5.LIST OUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLASSIFICATION IN DBMS AND EXPLAIN THEM IN DEPTH 
	→ 1. BASED ON DATA MODELS :
RELATIONAL DATA MODEL
→IN THIS MODEL THE TABLES RALATED TO EACH OTHER WITH SOME KIND OF  RELATIONSHIP , EX : MYSQL 
HIERARCHICAL DATA MODEL
→ IT’S A  TREE LIKE STRUCTURE MODEL THEIR CAN BE ONLY ONE PERENT NONE AND CAN HAVE ONE OR MORE CHILD 
EX. FILE SYSTEM OF OUR COMPUTER 
OBJECT ORIENTED DATA MODEL 
→IT’S A DATA MODEL WHERE THE DATA REPRESENT AS A REAL WORLD ENTITIES 
EX.O2 , JASMIN 
	    
   	     2. BASED ON NUMBER OF USER :
SINGLE USER DATABASE 
→ WHEN A DATA BASE USED BY A SINGLE USER THATS CALLED SINGLE USER 
EX. MOBILE PHONE , PC 
MULTI USER DATABASE 
→ WHEN A DATA BASE USED BY A MULTIPLE USER THATS CALLED MULTI USER DATABASE 
EX.AADHAR
 

	     3. BASED ON DATA BASE  DISTRIBUTION

CENTRALIZED SYSTEMS
→ WHEN THE DATA BASE IS HOSTED IN SINLGLE LOCATION ( IN A  CENTER ) AND ACCESSED FROM THEIR THEN IT’S CALLED CENTRALIZED DATA BASE 
DISTRIBUTED DATA BASE SYSTEM
→WHEN A DATA BASE HOSTED IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS ADN CONNECTED OVER NETWORK  THEN IT’S CALLED DISTRIBUTED DATA BASE 


6.WHAT IS SIGNIFICANCE OF DATA MODELING ? EXPLAIN THE TYPES OF DATA MODELING 
	→ WE USE COMPLEX DATA STRUCTURE TO STORE A DATA , WE DO COMPLEX PROCESSING TO DO SOMTHING ON DATA ,WE NEED TO SET DATA SIMENTICS TO STORE THE DATA , WE HAVE TO SET RELATIONS BETWEEN THEM  . AND EVERY THING HAPPENS BELOW THIS PHYCAL LAYER . BUT FOR NORMAL PEOPLE IT’S SO TOUGH TO DO THINGS AND UNDERSTAND THINGS  AND HERE COMES THE DATA MODEL IT’S PROVIDER A SYSTEM AND PROIVIDE US THE SIMPLIFIED VERSION SO NORMAL PEOPLE CAN USE DATABASE 

HIGH LEVEL CONSEPTUAL DATA MODEL 
→ A DATA MODEL WHERE THE DATA IS REPRESENTED LIKKE A REAL WORLD ENTITIES LIKE WITH FETURES , ATTRIBUTRES
EX.ENTITY RELATIONSHIP MODEL  (ER MODEL)
RECORD BASED LOGICAL DATA MODEL 
→ IT IS A DATA MODEL WHERE WE DECIDE MORE LIKE HOW THE DATA CAN BE STORE OR REPRESENT AND ENSURES IT FOR EASY TO UNDERSTAND, IT ALSO PROVIDE THE SIMPLIFID FORM FOR NOMAL USER
TYPES:
HIERARCHICAL DATA MODEL
→ IT’S A  TREE LIKE STRUCTURE MODEL THEIR CAN BE ONLY ONE PERENT NONE AND CAN HAVE ONE OR MORE CHILD 
EX. FILE SYSTEM OF OUR COMPUTER 
      2.NETWORK MODEL 
→ IT’S A COMPLEX FORM OF HIERARCHICAL DATA MODEL  IT’S ALSO A  TREE LIKE STRUCTURE MODEL WHERE EACH CHILD CAN HAVE ONE OR MULTIPLE PARENTS AND EACH PARENTS CAN HAVE ONE OR MULTIPLE CHILD
 EX. 

      3.RELATIONAL MODEL       
	→ IT’S A DATA MODEL WHERE WE  REPRESENTS THE DATA AS TABLES AND DEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TABLES 
EX.DATA IN COMPANIES 
     3.PHYSICAL DATA MODELS
	→ IT’S A DATA MODEL WHERE WE DECIDE HOW DATA IS STORED , RETRIVE AND ORDERED PHYSICALLY IN COMPUTER MEMORY   

7. EXPLAIN 3 SCHEMA ARCHITECTURES AND THEIR ADVANTAGES

	→  3 SCHEMA ARCHITECTURE :
EXTERNAL SCHEMA
→ HERE WE DECIDE HOW TO POTRE  SAME DATA TO DIFFERENTLY TO DIFFERENT  PEOPLE  AS A (VIEW OR WINDOW)
CONCEPTUAL SCHEMA  
→ HERE WE DEFINE THE DATA IN TABLE FORMS SETTING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEN THEM , AND ARRANGING DATA ETC..
INTERNAL SCHEMA 
→ THIS IS THE ACTUAL DATA . AND TRACKING OF HOW DATA STORED , RETRIVED 

     ADVANTAGES:
DATA INDEPENDENCE
MODULAR DEVELOPMENT 
DATA CONSISTENCY 
IMPROVE PERFORMANCE 
IMPROVE SECURITY
